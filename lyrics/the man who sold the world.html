<h1>The Man Who Sold The World</h1>
    <h2 class="cover">Original de David Bowie</h2>
    <h2>Adaptaci√≥n musical de <a href="http://lenino.net" target="_blank">Lenino</a></h2>
    <p>We passed upon the stair;</br>
      we spoke of was and when.</br>
      Although I wasn't there,</br>
      he said I was his friend,</br>
      which came as some surprise. I spoke into his eyes</br>
      "I thought you died alone a long long time ago."</p>
    <p class="chorus"> "Oh no, not me.</br>
      I never lost control.</br>
      You're face to face</br>
      with the man who sold the world."</p>
    <p> I laughed and shook his hand,</br>
      and made my way back home.</br>
      I searched for form and land,</br>
      for years and years I roamed.</br>
      I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here.</br>
      We must have died alone a long, long time ago</p>
    <p class="chorus"> Oh no, not me.</br>
      We never lost control.</br>
      You're face to face</br>
      With the man who sold the world</p>
