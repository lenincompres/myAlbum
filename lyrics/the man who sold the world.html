<p>We passed upon the stair;</br>
  we spoke of was and when.</br>
  Although I wasn't there,</br>
  he said I was his friend,</br>
  which came as some surprise. I spoke into his eyes</br>
  "I thought you died alone a long long time ago."
</p>
<p class="chorus"> "Oh no, not me.</br>
  I never lost control.</br>
  You're face to face</br>
  with the man who sold the world."
</p>
<p> I laughed and shook his hand,</br>
  and made my way back home.</br>
  I searched for form and land,</br>
  for years and years I roamed.</br>
  I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here.</br>
  We must have died alone a long, long time ago.
</p>
<p class="chorus"> Oh no, not me.</br>
  We never lost control.</br>
  You're face to face</br>
  With the man who sold the world
</p>
